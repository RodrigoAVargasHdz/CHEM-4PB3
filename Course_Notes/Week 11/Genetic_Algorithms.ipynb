        "1. **Population and Chromosomes**: A GA operates on a population of potential solutions, each represented as a chromosome. Traditionally, chromosomes are binary strings, but other formats like trees or graphs are also used.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Fitness Function**: Each solution's fitness is evaluated based on how well it solves the problem. This function varies depending on the specific problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Selection**: Solutions are selected for reproduction based on their fitness. The fitter the solution, the higher its chances of being selected, ensuring the propagation of better traits.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Genetic Operators**: The core operations in GAs are crossover (recombination) and mutation. Crossover combines the features of parent solutions to produce new offspring, while mutation introduces random changes to some solutions, helping maintain genetic diversity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Termination**: The algorithm iteratively improves the population of solutions and typically terminates when a satisfactory solution is found or a set number of generations have been processed.\n",

        "\n",
        "The concept of natural selection is effectively replicated in the world of machine learning through Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Here's how:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Survival of the Fittest**: In nature, organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. In GAs, solutions with higher fitness scores are more likely to be chosen for reproduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reproduction and Genetic Operators**: Natural reproduction involves combining genetic material from two parents, similar to the crossover operation in GAs. Likewise, mutations in biological organisms introduce new genetic variations, paralleling the mutation operation in GAs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Evolution Over Generations**: In nature, species evolve over generations, with advantageous traits becoming more prevalent. GAs simulate this process through iterative cycles of selection, crossover, and mutation, improving solution quality over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "This comparison highlights how the principles of natural evolution are ingeniously applied in machine learning to solve complex optimization problems.\n",

        "    - The GA is enhanced with a neural network-based adaptive penalty. This addition improves the diversity of generated molecules by encouraging exploratory behavior.\n",
        "    - A discriminator model (DNN) is trained and integrated into the GA's selection process, steering the GA towards more diverse molecular structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Use of SELFIES for Molecular Representation**:\n",
        "    - SELFIES (Self-referencing Embedded Strings) are utilized for representing molecules. This approach ensures the validity of molecular structures during the mutation process.\n",
        "    - The reliance on SELFIES simplifies the GA operation by eliminating the need for complex, expert-defined rules for mutation and crossover.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optimization Process**:\n",
        "    - The GA begins with simple methane molecules and competes favorably in optimization tasks for molecular design compared to other generative models.\n",
